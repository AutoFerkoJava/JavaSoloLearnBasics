/*
 * Variables store data for processing.
A variable is given a name (or identifier), such as area, age, height, and the like. 
The name uniquely identifies each variable, assigning a value to the variable and retrieving 
the value stored.

Variables have types. Some examples:
- int: for integers (whole numbers) such as 123 and -456
- double: for floating-point or real numbers with optional decimal points and fractional
 parts in fixed or scientific notations, such as 3.1416, -55.66.
- String: for texts such as "Hello" or "Good Morning!". Text strings are enclosed within double quotes.
