/*
 * In Java, every line of code that can actually run needs to be inside a class.
 In our example, we named the class MyClass. 
 You will learn more about classes in the upcoming modules.
 In Java, each application has an entry point, or a starting point, which is a
 method called main. 
 Along with main, the keywords public and static will also
 be explained later.

//As a summary:
// 1. Every program in Java must have a class.
// 2. Every Java program starts from the main method.
// Method: 
// a collection of statements that are grouped together to perform and operation
// also called a function
