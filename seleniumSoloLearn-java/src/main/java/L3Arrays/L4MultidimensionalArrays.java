/*
Multidimensional arrays are array that contain other arrays. 
The two-dimensional array is the most basic multidimensional array.
To create multidimensional arrays, place each array within its own set 
of square brackets. Example of a two-dimensional array:*/

		//int[ ][ ] sample = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6} }; 
		
/*
This declares an array with two arrays as its elements.
To access an element in the two-dimensional array, provide two indexes,
one for the array, and another for the element inside that array.
The following example accesses the first element in the second array of sample.
